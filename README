* This is a demo project that shows how to customize the appearance of UINavigationBar in 
iPhone apps by drawing custom backgrounds and changing the tint color. The method i used in this 
project is based on modifying the look of all UINavigationBars in an application-wide manner, however it 
is really easy to implement the same functionality to make it work with single UINavigationBar instances.
